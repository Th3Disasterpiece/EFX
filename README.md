### Enter The VFX (EFX) Tools for Houdini

This repository contains a collection of Python tools, shelf toolbars, and utility scripts that I commonly use as an FX artist working with Houdini. These scripts aim to streamline common tasks, improve efficiency, and enhance the overall user experience within the Houdini environment.

### Tools & Scripts:

1. **out_tools**:
- These are basic Python scripts accessible via right-clicking on nodes.

2. **snip_ui**:
- This is a work-in-progress UI that allows you to Save and Import nodes to disk for quick access.
- This helps create a personalized library of systems, examples, and setups commonly used for reference or starting points in the workflow.
- Demo and More updates with details to follow soon.
